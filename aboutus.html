<h2>Welcome to Microtech, your number one source for all things, Laptop, desktop, smartphones and computer parts and accessories. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of our products, with a focus on dependability, customer service and uniqueness.
Founded in 2020 by Mr. Aaron Agas, Microtech has come a long way from its beginnings in a small shop in his town. When Mr. Aaron Agas first started out, his passion for helping other people be more eco-friendly, providing the best equipment for his clients and customers drove him to  do intense research, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. We now serve customers all over the Philippines, and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky, eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the computer industry.
We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Aaron Agas, Microtech,  CEO, Founder
